Tools for management of gene signatures

A development package providing tools for reading a locally stored MSig Data Base file (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp) and storing it in a _tidyverse_ compatible format enabling easy search of the signatures by gene identifiers or signature names. Finally, signature scores can be calculated with the user-provided gene expression data with the Gene Set Variance Analysis (GSVA) technique.
